# Overview

This repository contains all papers and proposals for WG21 that cannot have
a proof of concept implementation, either because of the simplicity, subject
matter, or in some cases, due to their being opinion pieces. In some cases,
proof of concepts may be moved to their own repository, while keeping the
proposal *here*. This would greatly reduce the need for one to search for
my various proposals.

# Layout

Papers are currently written in the [bikeshed][1] format. Drafts are located in
the drafts directory and do not have a number. Once assigned a number, they are
moved to the proposals directory, and the file is renamed to the proposal
number (note: the revision is *not* part of the filename)
