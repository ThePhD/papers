# Motivation # {#motivation}

With the advent of Ranges, Executors, Coroutines, and monadic interfaces upon
us for C++20, we have a unique opportunity to create a uniform workflow
interface for expanding on each of the operations provided by the above types.

This paper proposes two operators, hereby dubbed the "workflow operators",
because they are not pipes, but for workflows. These workflow operators are
represented with the characters `|>` and `<|`. If you are currently seeing two
arrows on your screen, instead of a `|` and `>`/`<` combo, you probably are
using a monospaced font with ligatures enabled. This paper does not recommend
unicode specific characters.

Currently, ranges and executors plan on overloading the `|` operator. This has
unidirectional meaning, but more importantly has precedence in between the
"bitwise xor" (`^`) and "logcal and" (`and`) operators. This can cause odd
and unexpected behavior. One could argue that overloading `>>` and `<<` was a
mistake at the time. Perhaps we should take the opportunity to not repeat the
same type of mistake.

Adding these operators has specific consequences, namely we don't need a paper
everytime someone wants to add some kind of monadic operation to
`std::optional`, `std::expected/outcome` or similar monadic types. In the past,
people such as Ben Deane and Simon Brand, have spoken that the best operator we
can get for proper binding is to use `>>`. However, its precedence means that
we actually have to use `>>=`. Instead of overloading *that* operator, why
don't we overload `|>` instead?

We also would now have an operator that binds correctly when chaining
coroutines. Because `co_await` (or whatever possible glyphs the committee
chooses) binds so tightly, we are currently unable to safely chain coroutines
in continuations without having to rely on member functions, or passing said
coroutines into another function to be executed later.

While it is asking *a lot* to add more operators into C++20, the author
believes that this is an important requirement for composable and extensible
interfaces regarding the aforementioned executors, ranges, coroutines, monads,
and possibly even more interfaces.

# FAQ # {#faq}

## Does this have use beyond the stated examples so far? ## {#faq-uses}

Several people on the cpplang slack channel have mentioned that it would be
useful for function composition and binding, as well as a possible "infix"
operator.

## Does this work like the `|>` operator from `F#`? ## {#faq-fsharp}

The syntax is taken from F#, however the semantics differ greatly due to F#
being a garbage collected language, and an ML. C++ however is not either of
those and more things must be taken into account.

## Are there any plans to add `<|>` to this set of operators? ## {#faq-more}

At present there is no plan, however someone will probably find a use for it ðŸ™‚

In all seriousness, there are possible uses for it *if* (and only if) the
workflow operators are extended to futures to encapsulate both `when_all`,
`when_any` operations. However, with basic `|>` chaining, we get `when_all` and
`.then` operations on futures if we desire to extend this to them.

## Does this solve the same problem as UFCS? ## {#faq-ufcs}

No. UFCS gets us one step closer to concept maps and uniform interfaces. This
solves a different set of problems regarding operators.

## Isn't this just UFCS? ## {#faq-ufcs2}

No. UFCS has different semantics and requirements. This is just a regular old
operator users and library implementors can utilize to create extensible
interfaces with minimal interference into the way we write code.

## I dunno, seems like UFCS to me ## {#faq-ufcs3}

It's not UFCS. We have a new operator in C++20 (`<=>`). We still don't have
UFCS. This isn't UFCS. Stop saying it's UFCS. *It's not UFCS*.

## OK, it's just that it looks like its UFCS ## {#faq-ufcs4}

No.

# Examples # {#examples}

The following examples show ranges, coroutines, and monad operations when
chaining operations via the workflow operators.

## Ranges ## {#examples-range}

The following is taken (and modified) from the original ranges v3 draft

```cpp
int total = accumulate { 0 } <| view::iota(1)
                             |> view::transform([](int x){return x*x;})
                             |> view::take(10);
```

In the above we create a range on the righthand side of `<|` and then pass this
in to our imaginary accumulate type that takes a range after being initialized
with its initial value. This could also technically be written as

```cpp
int total = view::iota(1)
            |> view::transform([](int x){return x*x;})
            |> view::take(10)
            |> accumulate(0);
```

## Monads ## {#examples-monad}

## Coroutines And Executors ## {#examples-coroutine}

The following code is modified regarding coroutines and its (possible)
interactions with executors found in [[p1056r0]]. While this code may not seem
very explanatory, the interaction between coroutines and executors is still not
well defined. However, unlike the need to implement `.via` as a member function
and having to "await" any changes if newer and better interfaces are found,
users are free to implement their own interfaces on `task<T>`, coroutine types,
executors, or a combination of them.

Recall, however, that a coroutine *starts* suspended and it is up to the user
to decide how it is executed and where its continuation is placed.

### Case 2 ### {#examples-coroutine-2}

```cpp
co_await f() |> via(e);
```

### Case 3 ### {#examples-coroutine-3}

Starts by an executor `ex`, resumes in the thread that triggered the completion
of `f`

```cpp
co_await spawn(ex) |> f;
```

### Case 4 ### {#examples-coroutine-4}

Starts on executor `ex1`, resumes on executor `ex2`

```cpp
co_await spawn(ex1) |> f |> via(ex2)
```
